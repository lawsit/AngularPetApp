  <h2>
    <u>Technology Overview</u>
  </h2>
  <ul>

    <li> Back End Tool : Spring Boot with Security, Web, JPA and SQL Server</li>
    <li> Front End Tool : Angular 5 </li>
    <li>
      Cloud : The following components have been deployed to
      <strong>
        <u>Microsoft Azure Cloud</u>
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li> Angular Front End - https://petapp.azurewebsites.net</li>
        <li> Authentication and Authorization Web Service - https://authservice1.azurewebsites.net </li>
        <li> Pet Web Service to https://petservice.azurewebsites.net </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  </ul>

  <h2>
    <u>Design Overview</u>
  </h2>
  <ul>

    <li> User password sorted in the database has been encrypted with Bcrpt Hashing function</li>
    <li> For simplicty, there are only 2 user roles(Authority) - ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_USER </li>
    <li> ROLE_ADMIN can create, edit and delete Pet Records </li>
    <li> ROLE_USER can only view Pet Records </li>
    <li> Upon successful authentication, JWT(token) generated using SignatureAlgorithm.HS512 together with User Profile will be sent back to Front End </li>
    <li> Front End will save both the JWT and User Profile into sessionStorage></li>
    <li> Angular's HTTP interceptor is used to automatically attach JWT(token) to all http requests</li>
    <li> On Unit Testing side - Mock services are created by simply extending the original class and overriding few methods to
      return desired results that are required to complete the testing. EG, MockPetService is created to extend PetService
      and it overrides the getPets() method to return Faked Data for testing </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    <u>Limitation/Outstanding Items</u>
  </h2>
  <ul>

    <li> Under Microsoft Azure, the default configuration for FREE service plan is to unload any application if it have not been
      access for a certain amount of time, as a result, it will be slow on first request.</li>
    <li> Even though the program has been trying to customize the outgoing HTTP header with 'Authorization' and Token; the 'Authorization'
      header is still missing when the request is sent to Authentication server, it is still missing on </li>
    <li> However, it works fine when using POSTMAN to send the request with 'Authorization' and Token</li>
    <li> Because of this, the workaround is to have PetService separated from AuthService. The AuthService does the Authentication
      and returns the user profile to CLient. </li>
    <li> THe PetService handles all the REST API calls for CRUD operations on PET. </li>
  </ul>
